# One-Pagers – Standards and Guidelines

This folder contains **official Solarity AI one-pagers**.

A one-pager is a **single-page, high-signal document** designed to communicate the essence of a product, solution, or the company itself in under two minutes of reading time.

Every one-pager in this repository must meet the standards defined below.

---

## Purpose of a One-Pager

A Solarity AI one-pager must:

- Communicate the core value proposition instantly
- Be understandable by a non-technical audience
- Enable fast decision-making by investors, partners, or clients
- Serve as a leave-behind or pre-read document
- Represent the company accurately and professionally

If a document cannot be understood in under 2 minutes, it is not a one-pager.

## What a Perfect One-Pager Looks Like

A perfect one-pager is:

- Exactly **one page**
- Visually clean and uncluttered
- High contrast and scannable
- Structured, not narrative-heavy
- Focused on outcomes, not implementation details

It should answer the following questions immediately:

1. What problem does this solve?
2. Who is it for?
3. Why does it matter?
4. Why Solarity AI?
5. What happens next?

## Required Structure

Every one-pager must follow this structure, in this order:

### 1. Header
- Company logo
- Product or solution name
- One-sentence positioning statement

### 2. Problem
- Clear, concrete problem statement
- Written from the customer’s perspective
- No buzzwords

### 3. Solution
- What we offer
- How it directly addresses the problem
- Outcome-oriented language

### 4. Key Value Propositions
- 3 to 5 bullet points
- Benefits, not features
- Quantified where possible

### 5. Target Audience
- Explicitly stated
- Narrow and specific

### 6. Differentiation
- Why Solarity AI
- What makes this hard to replicate
- No competitor name-dropping unless necessary

### 7. Call to Action
- What the reader should do next
- Contact, demo, pilot, or follow-up

## Style and Tone Guidelines

- Professional and confident
- Minimal adjectives
- No marketing fluff
- No exaggerated claims
- No internal jargon
- Plain English preferred

Assume the reader is intelligent but busy.

---

## Design Guidelines

- One page only
- Consistent brand colors and typography
- Generous whitespace
- Icons over illustrations where possible
- Charts only if they add clarity

Design should support clarity, not distract from it.

---

## Versioning Rules

- Major content changes require a new version
- Old versions must be preserved
- Use versioned folders or filenames

Example:
```

company-one-pager-v1.pdf
company-one-pager-v2.pdf

```

---

## Approval Rule

No one-pager may be shared externally unless it is:
- Complete
- Reviewed
- Consistent with current company messaging
