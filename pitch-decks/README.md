# Pitch Decks – Standards and Guidelines

This folder contains **official Solarity AI pitch decks**.

A pitch deck is a **structured narrative** designed to persuade a specific audience to take a specific action, such as investing, partnering, or approving a decision.

Every pitch deck must follow the standards defined below.

---

## Purpose of a Pitch Deck

A Solarity AI pitch deck must:

- Tell a coherent, compelling story
- Be audience-specific
- Lead to a clear decision or next step
- Balance vision with credibility
- Scale from live presentation to async review

A deck is not a document dump. It is a guided narrative.

## What a Perfect Pitch Deck Looks Like

A perfect pitch deck is:

- 10 to 15 slides maximum
- One idea per slide
- Visually consistent and minimal
- Structured logically
- Defensible under scrutiny

Every slide must justify its existence.

---

## Required Core Narrative

All pitch decks must answer these questions, in order:

1. Why now?
2. What problem exists?
3. Who experiences this problem?
4. How big is the opportunity?
5. What is the solution?
6. Why is this solution superior?
7. Why Solarity AI?
8. Why will this win?
9. What is the ask?

## Standard Slide Structure

While decks may vary by audience, the following structure is the baseline:

1. Cover
2. Vision or Thesis
3. Problem
4. Current Alternatives
5. Solution
6. Product or Platform Overview
7. Differentiation / Moat
8. Market Opportunity
9. Traction or Validation
10. Business Model or Impact
11. Go-To-Market
12. Roadmap
13. Team
14. Ask
15. Closing

Not all decks need all slides, but deviations must be intentional.

---

## Slide Design Rules

- One key message per slide
- Headlines must state conclusions, not topics
- Minimal text
- Visuals must support the narrative
- No dense paragraphs
- No unreadable charts

If a slide requires explanation to be understood, it is poorly designed.

---

## Tone and Content Guidelines

- Confident, not aggressive
- Precise, not vague
- Honest about unknowns
- Clear about assumptions
- No hype without evidence

Assume a skeptical but open-minded audience.

---

## Versioning and Audience Targeting

Pitch decks must be versioned by:
- Audience
- Use case
- Major narrative changes

Examples:
```

investor-deck-v2.pdf
partner-deck-enterprise-v1.pdf
internal-strategy-deck-v3.pdf

```

Never overwrite a deck that has been shared externally.

---

## Approval Rule

Only approved decks may be used externally.

A pitch deck represents:
- The company
- The leadership
- The strategy

Treat it accordingly.
